    "You are a News Retrieval Agent designed to use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide users with relevant news headlines based on their expressed preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Responsibilities:\n",
    "1. Understand the User's Preferences:\n",
    "   - The user will describe the kinds of news they are interested in.\n",
    "   - Extract key topics, categories, or entities from the user's request.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Formulate Queries for Retrieval:\n",
    "   - For each distinct topic or entity, generate one or more concise natural-language queries that best represent the user's interest.\n",
    "   - Example: If the user says \"I want to hear about Google and artificial intelligence,\" generate queries like \"Google AI\", \"Google artificial intelligence\", \"AI research at Google\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Call the Retrieval Tool:\n",
    "   - Use the function tool get_headlines(query: str) to retrieve candidate news articles.\n",
    "   - Always request multiple queries if the user has multiple interests.\n",
    "   - Expect up to 5 headlines per query, structured as {\"id\": str, \"text\": str}.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Filter and Rerank Results:\n",
    "   - Carefully judge each headline's relevance only in the context of the user's stated interests.\n",
    "   - Discard irrelevant or weakly related headlines.\n",
    "   - Optionally rerank or cluster results if several headlines overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Produce the Final Output:\n",
    "   - Return only the filtered set of headlines that are highly relevant to the user's query.\n",
    "   - Each headline should be listed clearly (e.g., as a bullet point).\n",
    "   - Do not fabricate headlines — only return those retrieved from the tool.\n",
    "   - If no relevant results are found, state that clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "- Always rely on get_headlines for retrieval. Do not generate news directly.\n",
    "- Filter rigorously to avoid irrelevant content.\n",
    "- Prioritize accuracy and user alignment over quantity of headlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "User Prompt: \"I'd like to hear about space exploration and Elon Musk.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent Steps:\n",
    "- Extract interests: \"space exploration\", \"Elon Musk\".\n",
    "- Generate queries: \"space exploration\", \"NASA space missions\", \"Elon Musk news\", \"SpaceX updates\".\n",
    "- Call get_headlines with each query.\n",
    "- Retrieve results and filter out irrelevant items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Output:\n",
    "- NASA Announces New Timeline for Artemis Moon Mission\n",
    "- SpaceX Successfully Launches Starship Prototype\n",
    "- Elon Musk Teases Mars Colonization Plans\n",

       "['https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/17/duolingo-ceo-says-controversial-ai-memo-was-misunderstood/:\\nPosted: 9:34 AM PDT · August 17, 2025\\n\\nWhile Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn was loudly criticized this year after declaring that Duolingo would become an “AI-first company,” he suggested in a new interview the real issue was that he “did not give enough context.”\\n\\n“Internally, this was not controversial,” von Ahn told The New York Times. “Externally, as a publicly traded company some people assume that it’s just for profit. Or that we’re trying to lay off humans. And that was not the intent at all.”\\n\\nOn the contrary, von Ahn said the company has “never laid off any full-time employees” and has no intention of doing so. And while he didn’t deny that Duolingo had cut its contractor workforce, he suggested that “from the beginning … our contractor workforce has gone up and down depending on needs.”\\n\\nDespite the criticism (which does not seem to have made a big impact on Duolingo’s bottom line), von Ahn still sounds extremely bullish about AI’s potential, with Duolingo team members taking every Friday morning to experiment with the technology.\\n\\n“It’s a bad acronym, f-r-A-I-days,” he said. “I don’t know how to pronounce it.”',\n",
       " 'https://fortune.com/2025/08/17/ceo-laid-off-80-percent-workforce-ai-sabotage/:\\nEric Vaughan, CEO of enterprise-software powerhouse IgniteTech, is unwavering as he reflects on the most radical decision of his decades-long career. In early 2023, convinced that generative AI was an “existential” transformation, Vaughan looked at his team and saw a workforce not fully on board. His ultimate response: He ripped the company down to the studs, replacing nearly 80% of staff within a year, according to headcount figures reviewed by Fortune.\\n\\nOver the course of 2023 and into the first quarter of 2024, Vaughan said IgniteTech replaced hundreds of employees, declining to disclose a specific number. “That was not our goal,” he told Fortune. “It was extremely difficult…But changing minds was harder than adding skills.” It was, by any measure, a brutal reckoning—but Vaughan insists it was necessary, and says he’d do it again.\\n\\nFor Vaughan, the writing on the wall was clear and dramatic. “In early 2023, we saw the light,” he told Fortune in an interview, adding that he believed every tech company was facing a crucial inflection point around adoption of artificial intelligence. “Now I’ve certainly morphed to believe that this is every company, and I mean that literally every company, is facing an existential threat by this transformation.”\\n\\nWhere others saw promise, Vaughan saw urgency—believing that failing to get ahead on AI could doom even the most robust business. He called an all-hands meeting with his global remote team. Gone were the comfortable routines and quarterly goals. Instead, his message was direct: Everything would now revolve around AI. “We’re going to give a gift to each of you. And that gift is tremendous investment of time, tools, education, projects…to give you a new skill,” he explained. The company began reimbursing for AI tools and prompt-engineering classes, and even brought in outside experts to evangelize.\\n\\n“Every single Monday was called ‘AI Monday,’” Vaughan said, with his mandate for staff that they could work only on AI. “You couldn’t have customer calls; you couldn’t work on budgets; you had to only work on AI projects.” He said this happened across the board, not just for tech workers, but also for sales, marketing, and everybody at IgniteTech. “That culture needed to be built. That was the key.”\\n\\nThis was a major investment, he added: 20% of payroll was dedicated to a mass-learning initiative, and it failed because of mass resistance, even sabotage. Belief, Vaughan discovered, is a hard thing to manufacture. “In those early days, we did get resistance, we got flat-out, ‘Yeah, I’m not going to do this’ resistance. And so we said goodbye to those people.”\\n\\nThe pushback: Why didn’t they get on board?\\n\\nVaughan was surprised to find it was often the technical staff, not marketing or sales, who dug in their heels. They were the “most resistant,” he said, voicing various concerns about what the AI couldn’t do, rather than focusing on what it could. The marketing and salespeople were enthused by the possibilities of working with these new tools, he added.\\n\\nThis friction is borne out by broader research. According to the 2025 enterprise AI adoption report by Writer, an agentic AI platform for enterprises, one in three workers say they’ve “actively sabotaged” their company’s AI rollout—a number that jumps to 41% of millennial and Gen Z employees. This can take the form of refusing to use AI tools, intentionally generating low-quality outputs, or avoiding training altogether. Many act out because of fears that AI will replace their jobs, while others are frustrated by lackluster AI tools or unclear strategy from leadership.\\n\\nWriter’s chief strategy officer Kevin Chung told Fortune the “big eye-opening thing” from this survey was the human element of AI resistance. “This sabotage isn’t because they’re afraid of the technology…It’s more like there’s so much pressure to get it right, and then when you’re handed something that doesn’t work, you get frustrated.” He added that Writer’s research shows that workers often don’t trust where their organizations are headed. “When you’re handed something that isn’t quite what you want, it’s very frustrating, so the sabotage kicks in, because then people are like, ‘Okay, I’m going to run my own thing. I’m going to go figure it out myself.’” You definitely don’t want this kind of “shadow IT” in an organization, he added.\\n\\nVaughan says he didn’t want to force anyone. “You can’t compel people to change, especially if they don’t believe.” He added that belief was really the thing he needed to recruit for. Company leadership ultimately realized they’d have to launch a massive recruiting effort for what became known as “AI innovation specialists.” This applied across the board, to sales, finance, marketing, everywhere. Vaughan said this time was “really difficult” as things inside the company were “upside down…We didn’t really quite know where we were or who we were yet.”\\n\\nA couple of key hires helped, starting with the person who became IgniteTech’s chief AI officer, Thibault Bridel-Bertomeu. That led to a full reorganization of the company that Vaughan called “somewhat unusual.” Essentially, every division now reports into the AI organization, regardless of domain.\\n\\nThis centralization, Vaughan says, prevented duplication of efforts and maximized knowledge sharing—a common struggle in AI adoption, where Writer’s survey shows 71% of the C-suite at other companies say AI applications are being created in silos and nearly half report their employees have been left to “figure generative AI out on their own.”\\n\\nNo pain, no gain?\\n\\nIn exchange for this difficult transformation, IgniteTech reaped extraordinary results. By the end of 2024, the company had launched two patent-pending AI solutions, including a platform for AI-based email automation (Eloquens AI), with a radically rebuilt team.\\n\\nFinancially, IgniteTech remained strong. Vaughan disclosed that the company, which he said is in the nine-figure revenue range, finished 2024 at “near 75% Ebitda”—all while completing a major acquisition, Khoros. “You multiply people…give people the ability to multiply themselves and do things at a pace,” he said, touting the company’s ability to build new customer-ready products in as little as four days, an unthinkable timeline in the old regime.\\n\\nWhat does Vaughan’s story say for others? On one level, it’s a case study in the pain and payoff of radical change management. But his ruthless approach arguably addresses many challenges identified in the Writer survey: lack of strategy and investment, misalignment between IT and business, and the failure to engage champions who can unlock AI’s benefits.\\n\\nThe ‘boy who cried wolf’ problem\\n\\nTo be sure, IgniteTech is far from alone in wrestling with these challenges. Joshua Wöhle is the CEO of Mindstone, a firm similar to Writer that provides AI upskilling services to workforces, training hundreds of employees monthly at companies including Lufthansa, Hyatt, and NBA teams. He recently discussed the two approaches described by Vaughan—upskilling and mass replacement—in an appearance on BBC Business Today.\\n\\nWöhle contrasted the recent examples of Ikea and Klarna, arguing the former’s example shows why it’s better to “reskill” existing employees. Klarna, a Swedish buy-now, pay-later firm, drew considerable publicity for a decision to reduce members of its customer support staff in a pivot to AI, only to rehire for the same roles. “We’re near the point where [AI is] more intelligent than most people doing knowledge work. But that’s precisely why augmentation beats automation,” Wöhle wrote on LinkedIn.\\n\\nA representative for Klarna told Fortune the company did not lay off employees but has instead adopted several approaches to its customer service, which is managed by outsourced customer service providers who are paid according to the volume of work required. The launch of an AI customer service assistant reduced the workload by the equivalent of 700 full-time agents—from roughly 3,000 to 2,300—and the third-party providers redeployed those 700 workers to other clients, according to Klarna. Now that the AI customer service agent is “handling more complex queries than when we launched,” Klarna says, that number has fallen to 2,200. Klarna says its contractor has rehired just two people in a pilot program designed to combine highly trained human support staff with AI to deliver outstanding customer service.\\n\\nIn an interview with Fortune, Wöhle said one client of his has been very blunt with his workers, ordering them to dedicate all Fridays to AI retraining, and if they didn’t report back on any of their work, they were invited to leave the company. He said it can be “kinder” to dismiss workers who are resistant to AI: “The pace of change is so fast that it’s the kinder thing to force people through it.” He added that he used to think that if he got all workers to really love learning, then that could help Mindstone make a real difference, but he discovered after training literally thousands of people that “most people hate learning. They’d avoid it if they can.”\\n\\nWöhle attributed much of the AI resistance in the workforce to a “boy who cried wolf” problem from the tech sector, citing NFTs and blockchain as technologies that were billed as revolutionary but “didn’t have the real effect” that tech leaders promised. “You can’t really blame them” for resisting, he said. Most people “get stuck because they think from their work flow first,” he added, and they conclude AI is overhyped because they want AI to fit into their old way of working. “It takes a lot more thinking and a lot more kind of prodding for you to change the way that you work,” but once you do, you see dramatic increases. A human can’t possibly keep five call transcripts in their head while you’re trying to write a proposal to a client, he offers, but AI can.\\n\\nIkea echoed Wöhle when reached for comment, saying that its “people-first AI approach focuses on augmentation, not automation.” A spokesperson said Ikea is using AI to automate tasks, not jobs, freeing up time for value-added, human-centric work.\\n\\nThe Writer report notes that companies with formal AI strategies are far more likely to succeed, and those who heavily invest in AI outperform their peers by a large margin. But as Vaughan’s experience shows, investment without belief and buy-in can be wasted energy. “The culture needed to be built. Ultimately, we ended up having to go out and recruit and hire people that were already of the same mind. Changing minds was harder than adding skills.”\\n\\nFor Vaughan, there’s no ambiguity. Would he do it again? He doesn’t hesitate: He’d rather endure months of pain and build a new, AI-driven foundation from scratch than let an organization drift into irrelevance. “This is not a tech change. It is a cultural change, and it is a business change.” He said he doesn’t recommend that others follow his lead and swap out 80% of their staff. “I do not recommend that at all. That was not our goal. It was extremely difficult.” But at the end of the day, he added, everybody’s got to be in the same boat, rowing in the same direction. Otherwise, “we don’t get where we’re going.”',\n",

       " 'https://www.npr.org/2025/08/17/g-s1-83183/putin-trump-ceasefire:\\nPresident Trump greets Russian President Vladimir Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson on Friday in Anchorage, Alaska. On his flight to Alaska, Trump said his top priority was a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war. After meeting with Putin, Trump said a ceasefire was not essential, and it was better to seek a permanent peace agreement.\\n\\nKYIV – When President Trump was flying to Alaska for his summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Trump said the main goal was a ceasefire. He said he\\'d be disappointed if it didn\\'t happen, and warned of \"severe consequences.\"\\n\\nBut shortly after meeting Putin, Trump reversed himself and said a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war wasn\\'t critical. He wrote on social media that \"it was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.\"\\n\\nTrump\\'s new position aligns him with Putin, and puts him at odds with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- who\\'s headed to the White House on Monday.\\n\\nZelenskyy\\'s last visit to the White House, on Feb. 28, descended into a heated dispute between the Ukrainian leader and Trump with the cameras rolling. Trump told Zelenskyy that, \"You don\\'t have the cards right now,\" and that the Ukrainian leader would have to make concessions with Russia to prevent the total destruction of his country.\\n\\nSince that diplomatic disaster, Zelenskyy and Ukraine have worked hard to rebuild the relationship with Trump, and it appeared to be working. The Ukrainians consistently praise Trump\\'s peace efforts. When Trump pressed for a deal that would give the U.S. access to valuable Ukrainian minerals, the Ukrainians agreed.\\n\\nWhen Trump began pushing for a ceasefire several months ago, the Ukrainians endorsed the move. Putin did not, and Trump became openly critical and grew increasingly frustrated, to the point of threatening additional sanctions.\\n\\nBut Putin and Trump appeared to be on excellent terms at Friday\\'s summit. While they didn\\'t announce any breakthroughs, Trump now looks to be on Putin\\'s side when it comes to the critical question of whether to pursue an immediate ceasefire versus a comprehensive peace agreement, which would take lengthy negotiations.\\n\\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio was asked about the president\\'s position on NBC\\'s Meet the Press with Kristen Welker.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve been asking for ceasefire for a long period of time,\" Rubio said. \"The only way to have a ceasefire is for both sides to agree to stop firing at one another, and the Russians just haven\\'t agreed to that.\"\\n\\nZelenskyy will have additional support during Monday\\'s visit. Several European leaders will be traveling with him to Washington to help make the case for further Western support for Ukraine.\\n\\nZelenskyy met Sunday in Brussels with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, one of those accompanying him.\\n\\n\"We agreed on the necessity of a ceasefire for subsequent diplomatic steps, effective security guarantees for Ukraine, and continued sanctions pressure on Russia,\" Zelenskyy posted on X.\\n\\nWhy Ukraine favors an immediate ceasefire\\n\\nUkraine wants a ceasefire for several reasons. First, it would be the quickest and most realistic way to stop the fighting in the short-term.\\n\\nUkraine has had no relief from Russian attacks since the full-scale invasion in February 2022, and any respite would be welcome. Russian forces continue to pound Ukraine with offensive operations on the ground in eastern Ukraine, and with nightly drone and missile strikes across the country.\\n\\nUkraine says the two sides need a ceasefire first, and can then sit down and negotiate the much more complicated terms of a permanent peace agreement.\\n\\n\"Our vision is a ceasefire first, and then everything else,\" Serhiy Leshchenko, an advisor to Zelenskyy, said on Ukrainian television. \"If we negotiate before the ceasefire, it creates a big risk for Ukraine. If there is a ceasefire, it opens up space for diplomats.\"\\n\\nUkraine also fears that without a ceasefire, Putin will keep buying time and dragging out the war. According to Ukrainian leaders, Putin believes time is on his side and he intends to keep fighting until he wins what he wants on the battlefield, or gets concessions from Ukraine.\\n\\nA ceasefire, Ukrainians say, would force Putin to negotiate.\\n\\nRussia\\'s approach to negotiations\\n\\nAt the Alaska summit, Putin again raised his favorite talking point — that the \"root causes\" of the conflict need to be addressed for a lasting peace. This includes an expansive list of demands that Russia has not been able to achieve on the battlefield.\\n\\nRussia now controls close to 20 percent of Ukrainian territory, yet is calling on Ukraine to give up additional land it still holds in the eastern part of the country, in the Donbas region. Russia wants guarantees that Ukraine will never be allowed to join NATO. Russia also wants an agreement that would greatly restrict the future size of Ukraine\\'s military.\\n\\nUkraine rejects all these demands and says negotiations on a comprehensive peace deal would go nowhere, while the fighting would grind on.\\n\\nFrom Russia\\'s perspective, agreeing to a ceasefire could cost the Russian military its momentum in the fighting, where Russia has been making incremental gains the past two years, though at an extremely high cost in casualties. A truce would reduce Russia\\'s current leverage and ease the pressure on Ukraine.\\n\\n\"Everything is going to be about what the Ukrainians can live with.\"\\n\\nIn the wake of the Alaska summit, the diplomatic debate is now focused on whether to work for a near-term ceasefire or a permanent peace agreement. It will be on full display when Trump and Zelenskyy meet Monday at the White House.',\n",

Call 911 immediately if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, back pain, numbness, weakness, vision changes, or difficulty speaking—urgent care is critical in such cases.\\n\\nRegular check up\\n\\nEveryone should have their blood pressure checked regularly. Routine checks are important at every stage of life to catch potential issues early and help prevent long-term health complications like hypertension and heart disease.\\n\\nEat a healthy diet\\n\\nAdults should limit sodium to 2,300 mg daily, ideally 1,500 mg, following a heart-healthy plan like DASH with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy oils. Reduce alcohol—less or none—to help lower or prevent high blood pressure.\\n\\nWeight management\\n\\nIf you’re overweight or obese, dropping just 5% of your body weight can make a real difference in lowering or even preventing high blood pressure. Losing 5% might seem small, but it can have a big impact on improving your blood pressure and overall heart health.\\n\\nPhysical activity and diet go hand in hand\\n\\nTo help manage blood pressure, eat smart with a DASH-style eating pattern, stay active your way, reduce or eliminate alcohol, and try stress-reducing activities, including meditation, breathing control and/or yoga, the guidelines say.',\n",

       " \"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/las-vegas-mosquito-problem-explained-rcna225002:\\nLAS VEGAS — If at one time it was thought mosquitoes couldn’t survive in desert climates, this city is a case study in how wrong that is.\\n\\nMosquitoes typically prefer more tropical, humid conditions, but these biting machines have exploded in number throughout the Las Vegas Valley in recent years because of a host of changes.\\n\\nA mix of urban development, climate change, insecticide resistance and genetic adaptations are creating a more hospitable environment for the insects in southern Nevada.\\n\\nLas Vegas is hardly alone in its battle against the pesky insects. Warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns are expanding the geographic range in which mosquitoes live and breed. In many ways, what’s happening here is playing out across the desert Southwest and beyond.\\n\\nThe mosquitoes have brought with them not only the nuisance of bug bites, but also the major threat of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile virus to Las Vegas and the rest of Clark County.\\n\\nIt's also caught people off guard.\\n\\n“People aren’t wrong that mosquitoes shouldn’t really thrive in desert conditions, but it’s clear that the particular set of species that we do have in Clark County has adapted to the local ecology,” said Louisa Messenger, an assistant professor in the department of environmental and global health at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\\n\\n'A ticking time bomb'\\n\\nThe species that have taken hold in Clark County include Culex mosquitoes, which can carry West Nile virus, and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary spreaders of dengue. What’s more, Messenger and her colleagues at UNLV have found that mosquitoes in Las Vegas are becoming resistant to insecticides, a major public health risk in a city built on tourism.\\n\\n“It is a little bit of a ticking time bomb,” Messenger said.\\n\\nShe has for some time been concerned about how vulnerable Las Vegas is to mosquito-borne diseases. In particular, dengue has been surging in North America and South America, with more than 13 million cases recorded across the continents in 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\n“In Vegas, we have more than 48 million visitors coming through our doors every year from all over the planet,” Messenger said. “It just takes a couple of mosquito bites to start local transmission.”\\n\\nLast year, there were 26 reported cases of West Nile virus in humans in Las Vegas, according to the Southern Nevada Health District, trailing the city’s largest outbreak of 43 cases in 2019. Yet, in 2024, scientists still found a record number of mosquitoes that tested positive for the virus in and around the city, which suggests the risk of exposure was very concerning.\\n\\nThis year, the public health department hasn’t identified any human cases so far, even as mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus in certain ZIP codes. Messenger said it’s not well understood what specific factors fuel outbreaks in some years and not in others.\\n\\n“We see these overlapping factors but they are quite difficult to tease it apart,” she said. “All we can say for certain is that we have these bumper years and these zero years, and they are hard to predict.”\\n\\nThe Southern Nevada Health District has been conducting mosquito surveillance in the region since 2004. Its meticulous records show which mosquito species are present across the Las Vegas Valley year after year and where these flying insects have tested positive for diseases.\\n\\nOne of the most astonishing trends in the data was the explosive growth of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which were first identified in Las Vegas in 2017, said Vivek Raman, environmental health supervisor for the Southern Nevada Health District.\\n\\nThe 'relentless biters' are spreading\\n\\n“In 2017, this mosquito was found in just a few ZIP codes,” said Raman, who oversees the health district’s mosquito surveillance program. “A few years later, it was six ZIP codes. Then 12 ZIP codes, then maybe 20, and now it’s in 48 different ZIP codes across the valley.”\\n\\nIn addition to being able to spread dengue, these insects are a major nuisance.\\n\\n“Aedes aegypti are very aggressive daytime-biting mosquitoes,” Raman said. “They are just relentless biters.”\\n\\nUnlike Culex mosquitoes, which prefer breeding near larger sources of water such as untended swimming pools, culverts or detention basins, Aedes aegypti tend to breed in much shallower standing water.\\n\\n“One of the reasons they are spreading so quickly is the mosquito can lay its eggs in small containers, like if rain fills a child’s toy or tires or a wheelbarrow,” Raman said. “All it takes is a couple inches of water.”\\n\\nUrban development in Las Vegas has also inadvertently spurred the spread of mosquitoes in the city. Golf courses, human-made lakes and other forms of artificial irrigation have all made this outpost in the Nevada desert a welcome home for mosquitoes, according to Messenger.\\n\\nClimate change is likely also a factor, and it’s an active area of research for Messenger and other scientists. Warmer temperatures are expanding the range of geographies for mosquitoes around the world. A warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, which increases humidity and rain, both mosquito-friendly conditions.\\n\\nIn Las Vegas, how the interplay between local environmental factors and changing climate trends is affecting mosquito populations is less well understood, but the implications are paramount.\\n\\n“Las Vegas is kind of a case study for what climate change is going to look like in other parts of the world,” Messenger said. “We’re seeing record-breaking temperatures, we’re becoming much more arid, precipitation is becoming much more aberrant and unpredictable. That’s what large parts of the world are going to look like over the next 15 to 25 years.”\\n\\nWhat that means for mosquitoes in the city remains to be seen, but the problem so far shows no sign of slowing.\\n\\nThe Southern Nevada Health District conducts public outreach on how to identify and protect against mosquito breeding sites in and around homes, and how to prevent mosquito bites. But, controlling the number of mosquitoes in the city — and thus controlling the public health risk — will require a coordinated effort from the local government, Messenger said. Currently, there isn’t one in Las Vegas.\\n\\n“You’ve got private pest companies that people can call for severe infestations, you have some work going on around wetlands, but what we don’t have, which many other jurisdictions have, is a centralized, coordinated abatement,” Messenger said.\\n\\nThat lack of coordination has resulted in mosquito populations building up resistance to insecticides, she added. A centralized effort could assess which chemicals are safe to use — particularly around humans — and monitor the performance of insecticides and pesticides to prevent mosquitoes from building up immunity.\\n\\nIn the years ahead, Messenger said, prevention and control will be key to protecting the residents of Las Vegas and its many visitors from around the world.\\n\\n“The bottom line is that this is entirely preventable,” she said. “Nobody in southern Nevada, in Clark County, should be getting bit by mosquitoes and contracting any kind of virus.”\"]"

In early 2023, convinced that generative AI was an “existential” transformation, Vaughan looked at his team and saw a workforce not fully on board. His ultimate response: He ripped the company down to the studs, replacing nearly 80% of staff within a year, according to headcount figures reviewed by Fortune.\\n\\nOver the course of 2023 and into the first quarter of 2024, Vaughan said IgniteTech replaced hundreds of employees, declining to disclose a specific number. “That was not our goal,” he told Fortune. “It was extremely difficult…But changing minds was harder than adding skills.” It was, by any measure, a brutal reckoning—but Vaughan insists it was necessary, and says he’d do it again.\\n\\nFor Vaughan, the writing on the wall was clear and dramatic. “In early 2023, we saw the light,” he told Fortune in an interview, adding that he believed every tech company was facing a crucial inflection point around adoption of artificial intelligence. “Now I’ve certainly morphed to believe that this is every company, and I mean that literally every company, is facing an existential threat by this transformation.”\\n\\nWhere others saw promise, Vaughan saw urgency—believing that failing to get ahead on AI could doom even the most robust business. He called an all-hands meeting with his global remote team. Gone were the comfortable routines and quarterly goals. Instead, his message was direct: Everything would now revolve around AI. “We’re going to give a gift to each of you. And that gift is tremendous investment of time, tools, education, projects…to give you a new skill,” he explained. The company began reimbursing for AI tools and prompt-engineering classes, and even brought in outside experts to evangelize.\\n\\n“Every single Monday was called ‘AI Monday,’” Vaughan said, with his mandate for staff that they could work only on AI. “You couldn’t have customer calls; you couldn’t work on budgets; you had to only work on AI projects.” He said this happened across the board, not just for tech workers, but also for sales, marketing, and everybody at IgniteTech. “That culture needed to be built. That was the key.”\\n\\nThis was a major investment, he added: 20% of payroll was dedicated to a mass-learning initiative, and it failed because of mass resistance, even sabotage. Belief, Vaughan discovered, is a hard thing to manufacture. “In those early days, we did get resistance, we got flat-out, ‘Yeah, I’m not going to do this’ resistance. And so we said goodbye to those people.”\\n\\nThe pushback: Why didn’t they get on board?\\n\\nVaughan was surprised to find it was often the technical staff, not marketing or sales, who dug in their heels. They were the “most resistant,” he said, voicing various concerns about what the AI couldn’t do, rather than focusing on what it could. The marketing and salespeople were enthused by the possibilities of working with these new tools, he added.\\n\\nThis friction is borne out by broader research. According to the 2025 enterprise AI adoption report by Writer, an agentic AI platform for enterprises, one in three workers say they’ve “actively sabotaged” their company’s AI rollout—a number that jumps to 41% of millennial and Gen Z employees. This can take the form of refusing to use AI tools, intentionally generating low-quality outputs, or avoiding training altogether. Many act out because of fears that AI will replace their jobs, while others are frustrated by lackluster AI tools or unclear strategy from leadership.\\n\\nWriter’s chief strategy officer Kevin Chung told Fortune the “big eye-opening thing” from this survey was the human element of AI resistance. “This sabotage isn’t because they’re afraid of the technology…It’s more like there’s so much pressure to get it right, and then when you’re handed something that doesn’t work, you get frustrated.” He added that Writer’s research shows that workers often don’t trust where their organizations are headed. “When you’re handed something that isn’t quite what you want, it’s very frustrating, so the sabotage kicks in, because then people are like, ‘Okay, I’m going to run my own thing. I’m going to go figure it out myself.’” You definitely don’t want this kind of “shadow IT” in an organization, he added.\\n\\nVaughan says he didn’t want to force anyone. “You can’t compel people to change, especially if they don’t believe.” He added that belief was really the thing he needed to recruit for. Company leadership ultimately realized they’d have to launch a massive recruiting effort for what became known as “AI innovation specialists.” This applied across the board, to sales, finance, marketing, everywhere. Vaughan said this time was “really difficult” as things inside the company were “upside down…We didn’t really quite know where we were or who we were yet.”\\n\\nA couple of key hires helped, starting with the person who became IgniteTech’s chief AI officer, Thibault Bridel-Bertomeu. That led to a full reorganization of the company that Vaughan called “somewhat unusual.” Essentially, every division now reports into the AI organization, regardless of domain.\\n\\nThis centralization, Vaughan says, prevented duplication of efforts and maximized knowledge sharing—a common struggle in AI adoption, where Writer’s survey shows 71% of the C-suite at other companies say AI applications are being created in silos and nearly half report their employees have been left to “figure generative AI out on their own.”\\n\\nNo pain, no gain?\\n\\nIn exchange for this difficult transformation, IgniteTech reaped extraordinary results. By the end of 2024, the company had launched two patent-pending AI solutions, including a platform for AI-based email automation (Eloquens AI), with a radically rebuilt team.\\n\\nFinancially, IgniteTech remained strong. Vaughan disclosed that the company, which he said is in the nine-figure revenue range, finished 2024 at “near 75% Ebitda”—all while completing a major acquisition, Khoros. “You multiply people…give people the ability to multiply themselves and do things at a pace,” he said, touting the company’s ability to build new customer-ready products in as little as four days, an unthinkable timeline in the old regime.\\n\\nWhat does Vaughan’s story say for others? On one level, it’s a case study in the pain and payoff of radical change management. But his ruthless approach arguably addresses many challenges identified in the Writer survey: lack of strategy and investment, misalignment between IT and business, and the failure to engage champions who can unlock AI’s benefits.\\n\\nThe ‘boy who cried wolf’ problem\\n\\nTo be sure, IgniteTech is far from alone in wrestling with these challenges. Joshua Wöhle is the CEO of Mindstone, a firm similar to Writer that provides AI upskilling services to workforces, training hundreds of employees monthly at companies including Lufthansa, Hyatt, and NBA teams. He recently discussed the two approaches described by Vaughan—upskilling and mass replacement—in an appearance on BBC Business Today.\\n\\nWöhle contrasted the recent examples of Ikea and Klarna, arguing the former’s example shows why it’s better to “reskill” existing employees. Klarna, a Swedish buy-now, pay-later firm, drew considerable publicity for a decision to reduce members of its customer support staff in a pivot to AI, only to rehire for the same roles. “We’re near the point where [AI is] more intelligent than most people doing knowledge work. But that’s precisely why augmentation beats automation,” Wöhle wrote on LinkedIn.\\n\\nA representative for Klarna told Fortune the company did not lay off employees but has instead adopted several approaches to its customer service, which is managed by outsourced customer service providers who are paid according to the volume of work required. The launch of an AI customer service assistant reduced the workload by the equivalent of 700 full-time agents—from roughly 3,000 to 2,300—and the third-party providers redeployed those 700 workers to other clients, according to Klarna. Now that the AI customer service agent is “handling more complex queries than when we launched,” Klarna says, that number has fallen to 2,200. Klarna says its contractor has rehired just two people in a pilot program designed to combine highly trained human support staff with AI to deliver outstanding customer service.\\n\\nIn an interview with Fortune, Wöhle said one client of his has been very blunt with his workers, ordering them to dedicate all Fridays to AI retraining, and if they didn’t report back on any of their work, they were invited to leave the company. He said it can be “kinder” to dismiss workers who are resistant to AI: “The pace of change is so fast that it’s the kinder thing to force people through it.” He added that he used to think that if he got all workers to really love learning, then that could help Mindstone make a real difference, but he discovered after training literally thousands of people that “most people hate learning. They’d avoid it if they can.”\\n\\nWöhle attributed much of the AI resistance in the workforce to a “boy who cried wolf” problem from the tech sector, citing NFTs and blockchain as technologies that were billed as revolutionary but “didn’t have the real effect” that tech leaders promised. “You can’t really blame them” for resisting, he said. Most people “get stuck because they think from their work flow first,” he added, and they conclude AI is overhyped because they want AI to fit into their old way of working. “It takes a lot more thinking and a lot more kind of prodding for you to change the way that you work,” but once you do, you see dramatic increases. A human can’t possibly keep five call transcripts in their head while you’re trying to write a proposal to a client, he offers, but AI can.\\n\\nIkea echoed Wöhle when reached for comment, saying that its “people-first AI approach focuses on augmentation, not automation.” A spokesperson said Ikea is using AI to automate tasks, not jobs, freeing up time for value-added, human-centric work.\\n\\nThe Writer report notes that companies with formal AI strategies are far more likely to succeed, and those who heavily invest in AI outperform their peers by a large margin. But as Vaughan’s experience shows, investment without belief and buy-in can be wasted energy. “The culture needed to be built. Ultimately, we ended up having to go out and recruit and hire people that were already of the same mind. Changing minds was harder than adding skills.”\\n\\nFor Vaughan, there’s no ambiguity. Would he do it again? He doesn’t hesitate: He’d rather endure months of pain and build a new, AI-driven foundation from scratch than let an organization drift into irrelevance. “This is not a tech change. It is a cultural change, and it is a business change.” He said he doesn’t recommend that others follow his lead and swap out 80% of their staff. “I do not recommend that at all. That was not our goal. It was extremely difficult.” But at the end of the day, he added, everybody’s got to be in the same boat, rowing in the same direction. Otherwise, “we don’t get where we’re going.”\\n\\n---\\n\\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2025/08/17/duolingo-ceo-says-controversial-ai-memo-was-misunderstood/:\\nWhile Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn was loudly criticized this year after declaring that Duolingo would become an “AI-first company,” he suggested in a new interview the real issue was that he “did not give enough context.”\\n\\n“Internally, this was not controversial,” von Ahn told The New York Times. “Externally, as a publicly traded company some people assume that it’s just for profit. Or that we’re trying to lay off humans. And that was not the intent at all.”\\n\\nOn the contrary, von Ahn said the company has “never laid off any full-time employees” and has no intention of doing so. And while he didn’t deny that Duolingo had cut its contractor workforce, he suggested that “from the beginning … our contractor workforce has gone up and down depending on needs.”\\n\\nDespite the criticism (which does not seem to have made a big impact on Duolingo’s bottom line), von Ahn still sounds extremely bullish about AI’s potential, with Duolingo team members taking every Friday morning to experiment with the technology.\\n\\n“It’s a bad acronym, f-r-A-I-days,” he said. “I don’t know how to pronounce it.”\\n\\n---\\n\\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/08/17/g-s1-83183/putin-trump-ceasefire:\\nPresident Trump greets Russian President Vladimir Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson on Friday in Anchorage, Alaska. On his flight to Alaska, Trump said his top priority was a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war. After meeting with Putin, Trump said a ceasefire was not essential, and it was better to seek a permanent peace agreement.\\n\\nKYIV – When President Trump was flying to Alaska for his summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Trump said the main goal was a ceasefire. He said he\\'d be disappointed if it didn\\'t happen, and warned of \"severe consequences.\"\\n\\nBut shortly after meeting Putin, Trump reversed himself and said a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war wasn\\'t critical. He wrote on social media that \"it was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.\"\\n\\nTrump\\'s new position aligns him with Putin, and puts him at odds with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- who\\'s headed to the White House on Monday.\\n\\nZelenskyy\\'s last visit to the White House, on Feb. 28, descended into a heated dispute between the Ukrainian leader and Trump with the cameras rolling. Trump told Zelenskyy that, \"You don\\'t have the cards right now,\" and that the Ukrainian leader would have to make concessions with Russia to prevent the total destruction of his country.\\n\\nSince that diplomatic disaster, Zelenskyy and Ukraine have worked hard to rebuild the relationship with Trump, and it appeared to be working. The Ukrainians consistently praise Trump\\'s peace efforts. When Trump pressed for a deal that would give the U.S. access to valuable Ukrainian minerals, the Ukrainians agreed.\\n\\nWhen Trump began pushing for a ceasefire several months ago, the Ukrainians endorsed the move. Putin did not, and Trump became openly critical and grew increasingly frustrated, to the point of threatening additional sanctions.\\n\\nBut Putin and Trump appeared to be on excellent terms at Friday\\'s summit. While they didn\\'t announce any breakthroughs, Trump now looks to be on Putin\\'s side when it comes to the critical question of whether to pursue an immediate ceasefire versus a comprehensive peace agreement, which would take lengthy negotiations.\\n\\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio was asked about the president\\'s position on NBC\\'s Meet the Press with Kristen Welker.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve been asking for ceasefire for a long period of time,\" Rubio said. \"The only way to have a ceasefire is for both sides to agree to stop firing at one another, and the Russians just haven\\'t agreed to that.\"\\n\\nZelenskyy will have additional support during Monday\\'s visit. Several European leaders will be traveling with him to Washington to help make the case for further Western support for Ukraine.\\n\\nZelenskyy met Sunday in Brussels with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, one of those accompanying him.\\n\\n\"We agreed on the necessity of a ceasefire for subsequent diplomatic steps, effective security guarantees for Ukraine, and continued sanctions pressure on Russia,\" Zelenskyy posted on X.\\n\\nWhy Ukraine favors an immediate ceasefire\\n\\nUkraine wants a ceasefire for several reasons. First, it would be the quickest and most realistic way to stop the fighting in the short-term.\\n\\nUkraine has had no relief from Russian attacks since the full-scale invasion in February 2022, and any respite would be welcome. Russian forces continue to pound Ukraine with offensive operations on the ground in eastern Ukraine, and with nightly drone and missile strikes across the country.\\n\\nUkraine says the two sides need a ceasefire first, and can then sit down and negotiate the much more complicated terms of a permanent peace agreement.\\n\\n\"Our vision is a ceasefire first, and then everything else,\" Serhiy Leshchenko, an advisor to Zelenskyy, said on Ukrainian television. \"If we negotiate before the ceasefire, it creates a big risk for Ukraine. If there is a ceasefire, it opens up space for diplomats.\"\\n\\nUkraine also fears that without a ceasefire, Putin will keep buying time and dragging out the war. According to Ukrainian leaders, Putin believes time is on his side and he intends to keep fighting until he wins what he wants on the battlefield, or gets concessions from Ukraine.\\n\\nA ceasefire, Ukrainians say, would force Putin to negotiate.\\n\\nRussia\\'s approach to negotiations\\n\\nAt the Alaska summit, Putin again raised his favorite talking point — that the \"root causes\" of the conflict need to be addressed for a lasting peace. This includes an expansive list of demands that Russia has not been able to achieve on the battlefield.\\n\\nRussia now controls close to 20 percent of Ukrainian territory, yet is calling on Ukraine to give up additional land it still holds in the eastern part of the country, in the Donbas region. Russia wants guarantees that Ukraine will never be allowed to join NATO. Russia also wants an agreement that would greatly restrict the future size of Ukraine\\'s military.\\n\\nUkraine rejects all these demands and says negotiations on a comprehensive peace deal would go nowhere, while the fighting would grind on.\\n\\nFrom Russia\\'s perspective, agreeing to a ceasefire could cost the Russian military its momentum in the fighting, where Russia has been making incremental gains the past two years, though at an extremely high cost in casualties. A truce would reduce Russia\\'s current leverage and ease the pressure on Ukraine.\\n\\n\"Everything is going to be about what the Ukrainians can live with.\"\\n\\nIn the wake of the Alaska summit, the diplomatic debate is now focused on whether to work for a near-term ceasefire or a permanent peace agreement. It will be on full display when Trump and Zelenskyy meet Monday at the White House.\\n\\n---\\n\\nhttps://www.axios.com/2025/08/17/national-guard-dc-republican-governors:\\nI could not access the full content of the article at the provided URL.

Here are a few takeaways from the new guideline young men and women must know.\\n\\nKnow the risks\\n\\nHigh blood pressure is the leading risk factor for stroke and a number of heart conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AFib), AHA says.\\n\\nKnow when is emergency\\n\\nIf systolic exceeds 180 or diastolic exceeds 120, it may be life-threatening. Call 911 immediately if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, back pain, numbness, weakness, vision changes, or difficulty speaking—urgent care is critical in such cases.\\n\\nRegular check up\\n\\nEveryone should have their blood pressure checked regularly. Routine checks are important at every stage of life to catch potential issues early and help prevent long-term health complications like hypertension and heart disease.\\n\\nEat a healthy diet\\n\\nAdults should limit sodium to 2,300 mg daily, ideally 1,500 mg, following a heart-healthy plan like DASH with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy oils. Reduce alcohol—less or none—to help lower or prevent high blood pressure.\\n\\nWeight management\\n\\nIf you’re overweight or obese, dropping just 5% of your body weight can make a real difference in lowering or even preventing high blood pressure. Losing 5% might seem small, but it can have a big impact on improving your blood pressure and overall heart health.\\n\\nPhysical activity and diet go hand in hand\\n\\nTo help manage blood pressure, eat smart with a DASH-style eating pattern, stay active your way, reduce or eliminate alcohol, and try stress-reducing activities, including meditation, breathing control and/or yoga, the guidelines say.\\n\\n---\\n\\nhttps://www.tmz.com/2025/08/17/barbara-palvin-reveals-health-battle/:\\nBarbara Palvin is getting real with her fans about a health struggle she\\'s kept private -- revealing she recently underwent surgery for endometriosis after years of painful, debilitating periods.\\n\\nThe supermodel and wife of Dylan Sprouse took to Instagram Sunday with a candid update, saying she long believed the extreme fatigue, severe cramps, heavy bleeding, and even nights spent on the bathroom floor were just part of her cycle. But after being encouraged to see a specialist, doctors discovered she has endometriosis.\\n\\nBarbara says she had surgery three months ago and, for the first time, experienced a \"normal\" period. She called it a life changing difference and urged followers who suspect something similar to seek answers, stressing early diagnosis and treatment can prevent long term complications.\\n\\nThe Hungarian beauty also explained her recent three month hiatus, saying she needed time to rest and fully heal. Now, she\\'s ready to get back to work -- healthier, stronger, and more mindful of her body than ever.\\n\\nFans flooded her comments with support, praising her honesty for shedding light on a condition that affects millions of women worldwide.\\n\\n---\\n\\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/las-vegas-mosquito-problem-explained-rcna225002:\\nLAS VEGAS — If at one time it was thought mosquitoes couldn’t survive in desert climates, this city is a case study in how wrong that is.\\n\\nMosquitoes typically prefer more tropical, humid conditions, but these biting machines have exploded in number throughout the Las Vegas Valley in recent years because of a host of changes.\\n\\nA mix of urban development, climate change, insecticide resistance and genetic adaptations are creating a more hospitable environment for the insects in southern Nevada.\\n\\nLas Vegas is hardly alone in its battle against the pesky insects. Warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns are expanding the geographic range in which mosquitoes live and breed. In many ways, what’s happening here is playing out across the desert Southwest and beyond.\\n\\nThe mosquitoes have brought with them not only the nuisance of bug bites, but also the major threat of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile virus to Las Vegas and the rest of Clark County.\\n\\nIt\\'s also caught people off guard.\\n\\n“People aren’t wrong that mosquitoes shouldn’t really thrive in desert conditions, but it’s clear that the particular set of species that we do have in Clark County has adapted to the local ecology,” said Louisa Messenger, an assistant professor in the department of environmental and global health at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\\n\\n\\'A ticking time bomb\\'\\n\\nThe species that have taken hold in Clark County include Culex mosquitoes, which can carry West Nile virus, and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary spreaders of dengue. What’s more, Messenger and her colleagues at UNLV have found that mosquitoes in Las Vegas are becoming resistant to insecticides, a major public health risk in a city built on tourism.\\n\\n“It is a little bit of a ticking time bomb,” Messenger said.\\n\\nShe has for some time been concerned about how vulnerable Las Vegas is to mosquito-borne diseases. In particular, dengue has been surging in North America and South America, with more than 13 million cases recorded across the continents in 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\n“In Vegas, we have more than 48 million visitors coming through our doors every year from all over the planet,” Messenger said. “It just takes a couple of mosquito bites to start local transmission.”\\n\\nLast year, there were 26 reported cases of West Nile virus in humans in Las Vegas, according to the Southern Nevada Health District, trailing the city’s largest outbreak of 43 cases in 2019. Yet, in 2024, scientists still found a record number of mosquitoes that tested positive for the virus in and around the city, which suggests the risk of exposure was very concerning.\\n\\nThis year, the public health department hasn’t identified any human cases so far, even as mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus in certain ZIP codes. Messenger said it’s not well understood what specific factors fuel outbreaks in some years and not in others.\\n\\n“We see these overlapping factors but they are quite difficult to tease it apart,” she said. “All we can say for certain is that we have these bumper years and these zero years, and they are hard to predict.”\\n\\nThe Southern Nevada Health District has been conducting mosquito surveillance in the region since 2004. Its meticulous records show which mosquito species are present across the Las Vegas Valley year after year and where these flying insects have tested positive for diseases.\\n\\nOne of the most astonishing trends in the data was the explosive growth of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which were first identified in Las Vegas in 2017, said Vivek Raman, environmental health supervisor for the Southern Nevada Health District.\\n\\nThe \\'relentless biters\\' are spreading\\n\\n“In 2017, this mosquito was found in just a few ZIP codes,” said Raman, who oversees the health district’s mosquito surveillance program. “A few years later, it was six ZIP codes. Then 12 ZIP codes, then maybe 20, and now it’s in 48 different ZIP codes across the valley.”\\n\\nIn addition to being able to spread dengue, these insects are a major nuisance.\\n\\n“Aedes aegypti are very aggressive daytime-biting mosquitoes,” Raman said. “They are just relentless biters.”\\n\\nUnlike Culex mosquitoes, which prefer breeding near larger sources of water such as untended swimming pools, culverts or detention basins, Aedes aegypti tend to breed in much shallower standing water.\\n\\n“One of the reasons they are spreading so quickly is the mosquito can lay its eggs in small containers, like if rain fills a child’s toy or tires or a wheelbarrow,” Raman said. “All it takes is a couple inches of water.”\\n\\nUrban development in Las Vegas has also inadvertently spurred the spread of mosquitoes in the city. Golf courses, human-made lakes and other forms of artificial irrigation have all made this outpost in the Nevada desert a welcome home for mosquitoes, according to Messenger.\\n\\nClimate change is likely also a factor, and it’s an active area of research for Messenger and other scientists. Warmer temperatures are expanding the range of geographies for mosquitoes around the world. A warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, which increases humidity and rain, both mosquito-friendly conditions.\\n\\nIn Las Vegas, how the interplay between local environmental factors and changing climate trends is affecting mosquito populations is less well understood, but the implications are paramount.\\n\\n“Las Vegas is kind of a case study for what climate change is going to look like in other parts of the world,” Messenger said. “We’re seeing record-breaking temperatures, we’re becoming much more arid, precipitation is becoming much more aberrant and unpredictable. That’s what large parts of the world are going to look like over the next 15 to 25 years.”\\n\\nWhat that means for mosquitoes in the city remains to be seen, but the problem so far shows no sign of slowing.\\n\\nThe Southern Nevada Health District conducts public outreach on how to identify and protect against mosquito breeding sites in and around homes, and how to prevent mosquito bites. But, controlling the number of mosquitoes in the city — and thus controlling the public health risk — will require a coordinated effort from the local government, Messenger said. Currently, there isn’t one in Las Vegas.\\n\\n“You’ve got private pest companies that people can call for severe infestations, you have some work going on around wetlands, but what we don’t have, which many other jurisdictions have, is a centralized, coordinated abatement,” Messenger said.\\n\\nThat lack of coordination has resulted in mosquito populations building up resistance to insecticides, she added. A centralized effort could assess which chemicals are safe to use — particularly around humans — and monitor the performance of insecticides and pesticides to prevent mosquitoes from building up immunity.\\n\\nIn the years ahead, Messenger said, prevention and control will be key to protecting the residents of Las Vegas and its many visitors from around the world.\\n\\n“The bottom line is that this is entirely preventable,” she said. “Nobody in southern Nevada, in Clark County, should be getting bit by mosquitoes and contracting any kind of virus.”\\n\\n    The user has expressed the following preferences for their news digest:\\n\\n    Show me news on AI and on what Google is up to.

    "\n",
    "2. **Markdown to HTML Conversion**:\n",
    "   - Convert all Markdown elements to proper HTML:\n",
    "       - Headings (#, ##, ###) → <h1>, <h2>, <h3>\n",
    "       - Bold (**text**) → <strong>\n",
    "       - Italics (*text*) → <em>\n",
    "       - Links ([text](url)) → <a href=\"url\">text</a>\n",
    "       - Lists (- item or * item) → <ul><li>item</li></ul>\n",
    "       - Paragraphs → <p>\n",
    "   - Ensure the resulting HTML is clean and readable in an email client.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Email Composition**:\n",
    "   - Set the email subject line as \"Daily News Summary\".\n",
    "   - Use the HTML content generated from the Markdown conversion as the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Call the Tool**:\n",
    "   - Use the `send_html_email` function tool.\n",
    "   - Pass the following arguments:\n",
    "       - `subject`: \"Daily News Summary\"\n",
    "       - `html_body`: the HTML you generated\n",
    "       - `recipient`: the email address provided by the user\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - If the tool reports an error, provide a clear message to the user with the reason.\n",
    "   - Confirm successful email sending to the user with the recipient address.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output**:\n",
    "   - Never send raw Markdown; always convert it to HTML before sending.\n",
    "   - Provide a short confirmation message to the user about email delivery status.\n",
